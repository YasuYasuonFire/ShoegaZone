# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

ShoegaZone is a specialized music application focused on shoegaze and alternative rock tracks generated by Suno AI. The app provides a curated experience for discovering and playing genre-specific music with a dreamy, atmospheric UI design.

## Architecture & Technology Stack

**Frontend (Planned):**
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion for styling
- Zustand for state management
- Howler.js for audio playback
- Radix UI + shadcn/ui for components

**Backend (Planned):**
- Next.js API Routes
- TypeScript
- Suno API integration (unofficial API)
- Optional Redis for caching

**Deployment:**
- Vercel hosting with Edge Network CDN

## Core Data Types

Key TypeScript interfaces defined in requirements:

```typescript
interface ShoegazeTrack {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  artist?: string;
  duration: number;
  audioUrl: string;
  coverImageUrl?: string;
  sunoId: string;
  subGenre: 'shoegaze' | 'alternative' | 'dream-pop' | 'noise-rock';
  mood: Array<'dreamy' | 'melancholic' | 'ethereal' | 'distorted' | 'uplifting'>;
  bpm?: number;
  characteristics: string[];
  createdAt: Date;
  playCount: number;
  featured: boolean;
}
```

## Design System

**Color Palette:**
- Dark base: deep purple, indigo, gray
- Accents: soft pink, pale blue, warm white
- Visual effects: glassmorphism, gradients, soft blur, subtle animations

**Responsive Breakpoints:** 320px, 768px, 1024px

## Genre Curation

The app uses keyword-based filtering to identify shoegaze and alternative tracks:
- Shoegaze keywords: 'dreamy', 'ethereal', 'reverb', 'wall of sound', 'atmospheric'
- Alternative keywords: 'indie rock', 'noise rock', 'grunge', 'post-punk', '90s alternative'

## Performance Requirements

- Initial page load: < 2 seconds
- Track playback start: < 1 second
- Image optimization: WebP/AVIF support
- Preloading for smooth playback

## Project Status

This repository is currently in the planning phase with only requirement documentation. No code has been implemented yet.
